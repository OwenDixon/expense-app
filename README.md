# ExpenseApp

App to track your expenses.

Build using React & Redux, with Firebase as the backend cloud solution.

Tools used:
I have used airbnb's react-dates to implement a date picker, moment.js to 
format dates, and numeral to format currency.

The app is viewable on Heroku here: https://expense-app-v1.herokuapp.com/
